#  Create a Digital Clock in HTML CSS and JavaScript
In this creative coding project, we have created a fully functional digital clock from scratch using HTML for structuring our clock, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for adding dynamic functionality. This project is perfect for web developers and designers looking to improve their JavaScript skills and learn new techniques in CSS.
